# Steps to reproduce the results:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/code-farzi-baniya/Emotion-Recognition-Using-Transfer-Learning-with-DeepFace.git```

2. Always initialize with a virtual environment and then ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. ```Run the app.ipynb noptebook initally, to download the model weights and test out the demo to understand the workings```
